// Adding a new vulkan feature bool to daxa:
//
// 1. first classify the feature
//   - a feature is either required, implicit or explicit
//   - required features are features that will always be enabled, daxa needs them to work
//   - implicit are optional features with no perf overhead, they get enabled when supported
//   - explicit are optional features with perf impact, they are explicitly enabled in device creation
//
// 2. Check if the feature needs new extension
//   - if so, add it to PhysicalDeviceExtensionsStruct
//
// 3. Check if feature needs new physical device feature
//   - DISCLAIMER: some features dont have feature structs, like VK_EXT_conservative_rasterization.
//                 in such cases, add your own feature boolean to PhysicalDeviceFeaturesStruct!
//   - if so, add the struct to PhysicalDeviceFeaturesStruct
//   - also make sure to add initialization code for it in PhysicalDeviceFeaturesStruct::initialize
//   - PLEASE make sure to guard the init behind the extension beeing present in initialize
//
// 4. Now in impl_features.cpp, add the feature to either REQUIRED_FEATURES, IMPLICIT_FEATURES or EXPLICIT_FEATURES
//   - daxa uses these arrays to process features in create_feature_flags, create_problem_flags and fill_create_features
//   - orient yourself on other features.
//   - please encompass as many feature booleans into one daxa feature!
//   - now you will also have to to daxa_MissingRequiredVkFeature, daxa_DeviceImplicitFeatureFlagBits or daxa_DeviceExplicitFeatureFlagBits.
//   - please add it to the c and c++ code.
//
// 5. When adding new functions using a new daxa feature make sure to check if the feature flag is set.
//   - also consider adding a new daxa_Result code
//   - if you add a new daxa_Result code, update the print function in cpp_wrapper
