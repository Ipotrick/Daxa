# Welcome to the Daxa wiki!

This wiki is Daxa's documentation. It covers everything from building, using the various API features, and a small tutorial of how to use Daxa.

Check out the [Building Page](https://github.com/Ipotrick/Daxa/wiki/Building.md) for a rundown of how to install all the dependencies necessary to build Daxa, as well as building Daxa and running its samples!
For anyone interested in using Daxa, there is a [Tutorial Page](https://github.com/Ipotrick/Daxa/wiki/Tutorial.md) showcasing the creation of a basic app with a step-by-step explanation.
There is also a file containing solutions to [Common Problems](https://github.com/Ipotrick/Daxa/tree/master/wiki/CommonProblems.md).
Be sure to also check out the code samples inside the tests folder!
